Welcome to Siofra Dennehy's Github Profile! </br>
Here is a link to my favourite youtube video for the *vibes* -- <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qs_-emj1qR4"> It's worth watching, I promise :)

*About Me* </br>
I am a student in Software Development with a special interest in Cybersecurity and Quantum Computing. I recently partook in the Qiskit Global Summer School and completed all labs, which intensified my interest in Quantum computing and development. This led me to partake in Q-volution by the group Girls in Quantum and I am currently completing the course "ADEQUATE" by the company Qureca. Once completed, I will dive into "Quantum Sensing and Imaging", a course also run by Qureca along with QTIndu. I also run a Medium page where I do writeups on my latest TryHackMe endevours. I will link this page once I have caught up on my blog posts.  

My current projects include:
  - A Home Lab that consists of virtual machines that can attack/defend against the other.
  - A Home Lab initialised to safely analyse malware.
  - An automated Port Scanner application that utilises Nmap to scan user specified ports and output all results to a file of their choosing.
  - A benchmarking application to test the efficiency of different sorting algorithms.
  - A terminal based chat application that utilises multi-threading to share messages between users.
  - A Similarity Search application that utilises vector embeddings to rewrite a text with more commonly used words.

My favourite tools that I have utilised:
  - Wireshark
  - Nmap
  - Splunk
  - VirtualBox
  - Cisco Packet Tracer
    
Programming Languages I have worked with:
   -  Java
   -  Python
